A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and
 executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays 
 that program's output.

Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. 
There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating 
systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.
In Unix, there are two major types of shells −

Bourne shell − If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the $ character is the default prompt.

C shell − If you are using a C-type shell, the % character is the default prompt.

The Bourne Shell has the following subcategories −

Bourne shell (sh)
Korn shell (ksh)
Bourne Again shell (bash)
POSIX shell (sh)
The different C-type shells follow −

C shell (csh)
TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)
The original Unix shell was written in the mid-1970s by Stephen R. Bourne while he was 
at the AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey.

Bourne shell was the first shell to appear on Unix systems, thus it is referred to as "the shell".

Bourne shell is usually installed as /bin/sh on most versions of Unix. For this reason, it is the shell
 of choice for writing scripts that can be used on different versions of Unix.

In this chapter, we are going to cover most of the Shell concepts that are based on the Borne Shell.
